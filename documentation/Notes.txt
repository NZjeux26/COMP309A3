Certainly! Creating new features from existing data can be a great way to improve model performance, especially when dealing with similar genres. Here are some ideas for new features you could create based on the sample data you provided:

Tempo categories: Group tempos into bins like slow (< 80 BPM), medium (80-120 BPM), and fast (> 120 BPM).
Energy-danceability ratio: Divide energy by danceability to create a new metric.
Acoustic-electric ratio: Create a ratio of acousticness to (1 - acousticness) to represent the balance between acoustic and electric elements.
Dynamic range: Calculate the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of the song (if you have more detailed audio data).
Mood indicator: Combine valence and energy to create a mood score.
Vocal presence: Use the inverse of instrumentalness as an indicator of vocal presence.
Complexity score: Combine time_signature, key, and mode into a complexity metric.
Song length categories: Group duration_ms into short, medium, and long categories.
Speechiness-to-instrumentalness ratio: This could help distinguish between genres like hip-hop and instrumental music.
Popularity tier: Group popularity scores into tiers (e.g., low, medium, high).
Key-mode combination: Create a new categorical feature that combines the key and mode.
Energy variability: If you have data on energy levels throughout the song, calculate the standard deviation.
Danceability-tempo interaction: Multiply danceability by tempo to create a new feature.
Acoustic energy: Multiply acousticness by energy for a measure of acoustic intensity.
Lyrical density: If you have access to lyrics, calculate the number of words per minute.
Genre-based artist features: Create binary features for each genre an artist has appeared in.
Time signature simplicity: Convert time signatures to a numerical scale of simplicity.
Valence-energy quadrants: Create categories based on combinations of high/low valence and high/low energy.
Instrumentalness categories: Group instrumentalness into vocal-heavy, mixed, and instrumental categories.
Liveness-energy interaction: Multiply liveness by energy for a "concert energy" score.

These new features could help your model better distinguish between similar genres by providing more nuanced information about the songs. Remember to validate the usefulness of these new features through feature importance analysis or cross-validation to ensure they're actually improving your model's performance.
