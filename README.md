## Assignment Three: Kaggle Competiton 

Assignment Three was a Kaggle competiton to classify unknown music into specific Genres. We had to build a model that could succesfully classify a range of music dumped from the web into five categories:

-Blues
-Alternative
-Hip Hop
-Rap
-Classical
-Opera
-Comedy

Everyone was struggling to get over 50% fior many weeks until it was discovered the test data we had was wrong and had mislabeled thousands of records. After this fix most people were getting into the mid to high 70s.

The Repo contains my final report on my methods, results and diffacultly in this assignment, which there were many.
